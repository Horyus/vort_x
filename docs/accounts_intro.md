The `accounts` section contains the balance and transaction count of addresses you want to follow. You have the ability to set aliases to easily recover these informations (by default you will always have your coinbase address in the store, whith the alias `@coinbase`)

The balance and transaction count values are only updated upon new blocks.

You can add accounts with the `permanent` flag set to true to keep these accounts in the store even if it resets. This means you can add accounts during the store setup.
